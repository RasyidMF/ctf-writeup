Thanks for working on my Riyadh Reversing Challenge, I hope you enjoy it.

If you are new to Reversing, you may want to solve my Reyjkavik challenge first on CTFlearn.
It is a little easier than this challenge.

I also have a Reversing challenge called Rainbow; it is probably not for beginners.

Included in the challenge are the encrypted source files used to create the challenge.
The sources.zip.enc file is encrypted with the Challenge flag.

Solve the challenge, get the flag, decrypt the sources.

Decrypt with:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -k flag -in sources.zip.enc -out sources.zip

If you are not familiar with openssl encryption options, openssl enc -help is helpful :-)

Please don't share the flag or the sources used to build the challenge with anyone.
Please don't use the sources to create your own challenge for any CTF web sites or competitions.
I put a lot of time and thought and energy into creating these challenges and I don't want them shared.

Thanks!
