Thanks for working on my Reversing Challenge 'Riga'

This is designed as a 20 point reversing challenge for CTFlearn.
It is a little more difficult than my previous 10 point challenges in two ways... but you need to
find out what those two aspects are for yourself.

If you find this problem too difficult you should try my 10 point Reversing Challenges first:

Reykjavik
Riyadh
Rangoon

And then try my other 20 point reversing challenge Recklinghausen

When you solve this challenge, you can see the source files used to create the challenge if you are interested:

openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -in sources.zip.enc -out sources.zip -k flag

If you are not familiar with openssl:
openssl enc -help
shows the options available

Solve the challenge, get the flag, then you can decrypt the sources.

I am available on Twitter and Discord as @kcbowhunter, but I'm afraid you will have to
do your own research / learning on Reverse Engineering.  I have provided some online
resources in the file reversing to get you started if you are wondering how to begin learning
Reverse Engineering.
