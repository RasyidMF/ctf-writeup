# My Blog (20 Points)
Hi, I'm Noxtal! I have hidden a flag somewhere in my Cyberworld (AKA blog)... you may find a good <strong>application</strong> for your <strong>memory</strong>. ;)
<br>
Note: This is my real website (thus no deadly bug to exploit here). You might want to read some of my content (writeups, tutorials, and cheatsheets). I would be glad to receive any kind of feedback.
<br>
Click here to access it, have fun checking my blog out! Cheers!

Hint: replace the flag{} part with CTFlearn{}.
