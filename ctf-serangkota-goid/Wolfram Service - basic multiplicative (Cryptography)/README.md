We will learn basic solver using wolfram, the case is multiplicative array dimensions that would find vairable a, b, c, d multiply key. Try Input This:
solve { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4, 1}, {3, 4, 1, 2}, {4, 1, 2, 3} } . { a, b, c, d } == {1066, 1042, 1030, 1062}

Input Your Solver/Queries: solve { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4, 1}, {3, 4, 1, 2}, {4, 1, 2, 3} } . { a, b, c, d } == {1066, 1042, 1030, 1062}
You're Correct Here's The Key & Flag: halo & DiskoCTF{big_machine_wolfram}
